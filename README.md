# Evaluation of the causal effect of disruption on delay as a benchmarking tool for public transport network performance
While black-box models are becoming increasingly accurate for prediction problems, the desire to master and understand the relationships between factors and the dependent variables is driving the need for the development of Causal Inference, which is gaining momentum. Urban mass transit systems typically generate large volumes of data on various aspects of operations. Statistical analyses can be used to summarise and present such data, drawn from within and between systems, to understand the drivers of performance. This empirical analysis leverages large-scale publicly available data from the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) feed of the Washington DC metro network to characterise the performance of transit systems, focusing on train on-time performance and the space-time propagation of disruption causing subsequent delays.
